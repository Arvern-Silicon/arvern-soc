# File Name          : rules.tcl
# Module Description : VC Static lint rule policy for arvern_fpga -- per-tag enable/disable on top of the stage selection.
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PROVENANCE: copied verbatim from arvern/lint/vc_static/rules.tcl. It is a
# house policy, not a design-specific one -- the aRVern-named examples in the
# rationale comments below are illustrations of WHY a rule is off, and apply
# equally to the FPGA SoC (which elaborates that very core plus the IPs). Keep
# the files in step: a rule that is noise for the core is noise for the SoC, and
# divergence should be a deliberate, commented choice.
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT THIS FILE IS
#   The shipped tag set is a superset of several vendors' house coding
#   standards. This file turns off the rules that encode a standard aRVern does
#   not follow, so that what remains is defects rather than style. Stage
#   selection itself lives in run_vclint (VCLINT_STAGES); this file only refines
#   the enabled set.
#
# HOW TO ADD A RULE HERE
#   Take the tag name from results/report.lint_full.txt (NOT from
#   proverilog.log -- see the namespace note below), append it to the matching
#   list, and give it a one-line reason. Prefer fixing the RTL over disabling a
#   rule, and prefer a scoped waiver in waivers.tcl over a global disable when
#   the RTL is correct and only this rule disagrees.
#
# TAG NAMESPACE
#   configure_hdl_tag and report_hdl use VC tag names (CODING_*, CONN_*, NTL_*,
#   SYN_*). The VER_* / R_* / X_* identifiers in results/proverilog.log are the
#   Leda engine's internal numbering and mean nothing to configure_hdl_tag --
#   naming one here silently matches nothing.
#

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Translated SpyGlass rulesets (SG_*)
#
# Roughly 2400 of the LANGUAGE_CHECK tags are other organisations' house
# standards (SG_STARC2002/2005, SG_LINT, SG_MORELINT, SG_OPENMORE) and
# vendor-internal ones (SG_INTEL, SG_AMD, SG_MTK, SG_SARC).
#
# The native CODING_* / SYN_* rules underneath are KEPT -- those are the real
# language-semantics and synthesizability checks (casex without default, bits
# shifted out, self-assignment, signed/unsigned mixing, system tasks in RTL).
#
# The list is harvested from the live catalog rather than hard-coded, so it
# cannot go stale on a tool upgrade. No effect unless -lang is passed.

#   NAMING_INST_PIN_NET_SAME           pin and net must share a name
#       aRVern deliberately maps e.g. clk_i -> hclk_i at instantiation.
#   NAMING_PORT_IN_OUT_UPPER_CASE      uppercase port names
#       aRVern uses lowercase with _i/_o suffixes.
#   NAMING_MOD_PARAM_NAME              parameters must start with P_
#   NAMING_ARRAY_NOT_HARD_CODED        hard-coded bus sizes discouraged
#   CODING_NAMING_INST_NUMPREFIX       instance names must embed the module name

#   SYN_DECL_NET_ASSIGN                "no assignment in net declaration"
#       Would flag most continuous assignments in the core.
#   CODING_STMT_PARAM_CONST            numeric literals should be parameters
#       Impractical for ISA opcode encodings.
#   CODING_EXPR_NESTED_CONDEXPR        no nested conditional expressions
#       The decode priority muxes are nested by design.
#
# KEPT deliberately, despite sitting in the same CODING_ALWAYS_* / CODING_CASE_*
# space: CODING_ALWAYS_NO_ELSE and CODING_CASE_LATCHLIKE are latch-inference

# "Critical Timing Path" section of CLAUDE.md), and AHB-Lite address/control
# generation is combinational by protocol. Satisfying these rules would mean

# Hierarchy / path-topology methodology
#
# NETLIST stage -- affects the default run. These describe how logic is
# partitioned across the hierarchy, not whether it is correct.
#
#   CODING_HW_SNAKE_PATH        signals threaded through a module without local use
#   CODING_TREE_RECOV_PATH      reconvergent fanout -- inherent in any real datapath
#   CODING_INST_NOT_UNIQUIFIED  "netlist not uniquified" -- unavoidable at RTL, since
#                               arv_dff is instantiated ~250 times and uniquification
#                               is a Design Compiler step, not an RTL property
#   CODING_HW_GLUE_LOGIC        "avoid glue logic at top level" -- arvern.v wires
#                               submodules together with assigns, which is what a
#                               top level is for
#   CODING_HW_MULT_FANOUT       one net driving two ports of the same instance
#
# The last three below are one coding style reported under three different
# tags: aRVern reads its own output ports. arv_fetch, for example, drives
# id_pc_o and then reads it throughout the module -- id_pc_o IS the PC. That is
# legal Verilog; the alternative is an internal wire plus `assign port = wire`,
# which synthesises identically. A rename sweep through arv_fetch/arv_decode,
# the modules carrying the documented critical path, would buy a lint metric
# and nothing else.
#
#   CODING_HW_REENTRANT_PATH    an output re-enters its own module
#   CONN_PORT_MODOUT_SUBIN      an output also drives a sub-module input
#   CODING_PORT_READ_OUTPUT     reading from an output port (LANGUAGE_CHECK only)
#   CONN_PORT_CONN_MISMATCH    147  "undriven bits detected in port connection"
#       The fourth name for this style, and the most misleadingly worded: it
#       fires when a net's only driver is a CHILD module's output port rather
#       than an assign in the parent -- that is, on ordinary hierarchical
#       wiring. Two shapes, both traced to the RTL and both properly driven:
#         - a parent output wired straight to a submodule output, e.g.
#           arv_csr_top.cfg_timeout_wait_o, driven from mstatus_tw at
#           arv_csr_traps.v:851
#         - an internal wire between two submodules, e.g. trig_m_trap_entry,
#           driven by arv_csr_traps and consumed by arv_debug_trigger
#       Complying would mean an intermediate wire plus an explicit assign for
#       every inter-module net in the design.
#   CONN_PORT_INPUT_DEFINEDAS_OUTPUT  7  "input defined as output" -- the fifth
#       name for the same style, seen from the consuming side: a module reads
#       its own output port as an input, e.g. arv_csr_cntr feeding time_req_o
#       into a flop enable, or arv_load_store reading data_haddr_o.
#   CODING_TREE_NO_FEEDTHROU    an input wired straight to an output with no
#       logic between. Silent on the core; fires ~30 times on any SoC top,
#       every one of them AHB fabric doing its job: ahb_subordinate_mux
#       replicating the address phase to every subordinate
#       (s_haddr_o = {NR_S{haddr_i}}), ahb_manager_if's hsel_o = m_grant_i,
#       the SRAM controllers exporting hclk_i as sram_clk_o and passing
#       zero-wait-state read data straight through, the fused interconnect
#       handing m_x_haddr_i to the external decoder. A fabric that did not
#       feed through would not be a fabric. Same class as SNAKE_PATH above.
#
# CAREFUL: this is a hand-picked list, NOT the CODING_HW_* / CODING_TREE_*
# families. Those families also contain CODING_TREE_ASYNC_FDBKLOOP (async
# feedback loop), CODING_TREE_SYNC_LOOP (combinational loop),
# CODING_TREE_SETRST_ORIG (set and reset from a common source) and
# CODING_HW_PULSE_GEN -- all real defect detectors that stay ENABLED. Do not
# turn this into a prefix sweep.

#                        -- fires on any flop that IS async-reset
#
# Enabling the one that matches the build turns it into a positive check that
# the reset architecture is uniform: in an async build any stray sync flop is
# flagged, and in a sync build any stray async flop is flagged. The other is
# disabled, since it would otherwise flag every flop in the design.
#
# rules.tcl is sourced after rtl_params.tcl, so the elaboration parameters are
# in scope here. Default to the async expectation if the parameter is absent
# (e.g. -no_params), matching arvern.v's own default.

#   CODING_INST_PARAMETER          every parameter must be named explicitly at

#                                  dismissed: this rule WOULD catch an instance
#                                  silently inheriting a default it did not
#                                  intend -- e.g. an arv_dff missing

#                                  a sync-reset build. Kept off because arvern
#                                  deliberately relies on defaults (arv_dff has
#                                  three parameters, most instances want
#                                  WIDTH=1), an audit confirmed 250/250
#                                  instances propagate ARST_EN, and compliance
#                                  would mean naming every defaulted parameter
#                                  across ~237 sites. Re-enable if that
#                                  guarantee is ever wanted enforced rather
#                                  than audited.

#                                  generally; an advisory, not a defect
